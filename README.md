Keywords:  
climatic gradients, mountain forests soils, volcanic ash soils, Andosols, SOC, forest vegetation types 

Highlights:
-	Soil development is superimposed by rejuvenation with young volcanic deposition. 
-	CN ration is the most direct effect of the vegetation on edaphic parameters.
-	Driving factors are soil water balance, thermal conditions, and biological activity.

**Abstract**:<p align="justify">
The mountain forests of Northern are one of the world’s largest continuous deciduous forest areas with only moderate impact of forest management, representing a steep precipitation gradient from the humid hyperoceanic conditions of the Valdivian temperate rainforests in the west to the xeric-pluviseasonal forest steppe ecotone in the east. The aim of the study is to enhance the understanding of forest soil properties and processes along interacting gradients, and to provide solid data and baseline information for a study region with limited information available. 
We therefore collected 45 soil profile and 66 topsoil data along 16 elevational transects separated in 4 sections along the climatic gradient in two replicated west-east valley transects. From the soil profile descriptions with standard chemical soil analyses 24 profiles were selected for selective dissolution analysis of Al, Fe, Si oxides and PO4 retention, and 5 for XRD analysis of mineralogical composition.
We found distinct patterns of soil development along the humidity gradient from moisture to xeric soil water balance conditions, along the thermal conditions from mountain to subalpine forest types, and with changing biological activity characterised by CN ratio of the topsoil. Volcanic ash deposition regularly rejuvenates soils, particularly in the humid west, influencing both mineral composition and pedogenetic development. The distinct tree species composition of the forest types also plays a significant role in shaping soil properties. 
Our findings reveal a complex interplay between climate, vegetation, and volcanic depositon, which has implications for understanding pedogenetic development and properties in the northern Patagonian forests.
