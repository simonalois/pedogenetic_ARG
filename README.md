Keywords:  
climatic gradients, mountain forests soils, volcanic ash soils, Andosols, SOC, forest vegetation types 

Highlights:
-	Soil development has continuously been rejuvenated by young volcanic deposits. 
-	Driving factors were soil water balance, thermal conditions, and litter quality.
-	Vegetation affected soil properties mainly through the CN ratio of its litter. 
-	Changes in mineralogical composition additionally influence soil development.

Abstract
The mountain forests of Northern Patagonia are one of the world’s largest contiguous deciduous forest areas with only moderate impact of forest management. They represent a steep hydroclimatic gradient, with a humid to xeric soil water balance from west to east, and pronounced elevation gradients. The aim of this study was to elucidate forest soil formation along these interacting gradients and to disentangle the various influencing factors. We collected 45 soil profile and 66 topsoil samples along 16 elevational transects located in 4 sections along the moisture gradient in two replicated west-to-east valley transects. Based on soil profile descriptions and standard chemical soil analyses, 24 profiles were further characterised by selective dissolution analysis of short-range order minerals and PO4 retention, and 5 profiles were analysed for bulk and clay mineralogical composition. <br> 
We found distinct patterns of soil development along the hydroclimatic gradient, along the elevation (thermal) gradient, and with changing litter quality characterised by the CN ratio. The distinct plant species composition of the forest types plays a significant role in shaping soil properties through the CN ratio of the ecto-organic layer and topsoil. Volcanic ash deposition regularly rejuvenates soils, particularly in the humid west, influencing both mineral composition and pedogenetic development. We partly attribute the less pronounced expression of andic properties in the east to aeolian deposition of non-volcanic material. <br> 
Our findings reveal a complex interplay between climate, vegetation, and volcanic deposition, which has implications for understanding pedogenetic development and the effects of climate change in the Northern Patagonian forests.<br>
